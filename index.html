                    <h3>Burger Chef: Legacy</h3>
                    <img <p>In 1954, Frank and Donald Thomas patented the flame broiler in their parent company General
                    Equipment
                    Corporation and started their own restaurant in Indianapolis, Indiana. In 1957, they opened
                    their first
                    Burger Chef.</p>

                    <p>Burger Chef spread across the United States, following a strategy of opening outlets in smaller
                        towns.[2] By 1972 its number of locations (1,200) was surpassed only by McDonald's (1,600).[3]
                        They
                        offered a double burger, called the Big Shef, and later the quarter-pound hamburger, Super Shef.
                        Subsequently, they added the Works Bar, where customers added their own toppings to hamburgers.
                    </p>

                    <p>In 1968, General Foods Corporation purchased the chain and continued its rapid expansion. At the
                        time of
                        the purchase by General Foods, Burger Chef had 600 locations in 39 states.[4] By 1969
                        international
                        expansion was underway with General Foods building ten Burger Chef outlets in Australia. The
                        expansion
                        would end in 1975 with a $1.3 Million loss. It was stated that Australians disliked the limited
                        burger
                        based menu as compared to a Milk Bar. [5] The chain had two mascots: Burger Chef (voiced by Paul
                        Winchell) and Jeff (the chef's juvenile sidekick). In the early 1970s, the chain introduced the
                        Funburger and the Funmeal, with packaging that included stories about Burger Chef and Jeff's
                        adventures
                        and friends (including the magician Burgerini, vampire Count Fangburger, talking ape Burgerilla,
                        and
                        Cackleburger the witch), with riddles, puzzles, and small toys. When McDonald's introduced their
                        Happy
                        Meal in 1979, the chain sued, but ultimately lost.</p>

                    <p>In 1982, General Foods sold Burger Chef to the Canadian company Imasco, which also owned
                        Hardee's, for
                        $44 million.[6] Imasco converted many locations to Hardee's restaurants and let franchises and
                        locations
                        near existing Hardee's locations convert to other brands. Remaining restaurants that did not
                        convert to
                        Hardee's or new names and branding simply closed.</p>
